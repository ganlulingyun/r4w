# AM Broadcast Radio Waveform Specification
#
# Standard AM broadcasting as used in the Medium Wave (MW) band.
# This is one of the oldest radio modulation techniques, still in widespread use.
#
# Key characteristics:
#   - Simple envelope detection at receiver
#   - Carrier always present (unlike DSB-SC)
#   - Both sidebands transmitted (redundant but robust)
#   - Audio bandwidth limited to ~5 kHz
#
# Example use: Generating/analyzing AM broadcast signals for SDR experimentation

      - "AM broadcast radio (540-1600 kHz)"

# AM Signal Structure:
#   s(t) = A_c[1 + m·x(t)]·cos(2πf_c·t)
#
# Where:
#   A_c = Carrier amplitude
#   m   = Modulation index (depth)
#   x(t)= Normalized baseband signal (-1 to +1)
#   f_c = Carrier frequency
#
# Power Distribution (for sinusoidal modulating signal):
#   P_carrier = A_c²/2
#   P_sideband = m²·P_carrier/2 (each sideband)
#   P_total = P_carrier(1 + m²/2)
#
# At 100% modulation (m=1):
#   - 2/3 (66.7%) of power is in the carrier (wasted)
#   - 1/3 (33.3%) of power is in sidebands (information)
#
# Why DSB-FC is still used:
#   1. Simple envelope detection (diode + capacitor)
#   2. No carrier recovery needed at receiver
#   3. Robust against fading and multipath
#   4. Compatible with billions of AM radios worldwide
#
# Variations:
#   - DSB-SC: Suppressed carrier (more efficient, complex receiver)
#   - SSB: Single sideband (half bandwidth, even more complex)
#   - VSB: Vestigial sideband (TV video, compromise)
